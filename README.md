# Welcome to speedrundle, the daily-game speedrun challenge
This site acts as a hub for a daily-game speedrun devised by Stanz, and commonly played by my friends and I for weeks on end. Here are the rules....

You will select a variety of daily games from our collection of sites. You will be able to order them in the way that you want, and they will open in that order when you begin. A vanilla run will be provided to you, which is the the original run devised by Stanz.

The leaderboard contains the scores for all vanilla runs. The leaderboard will contain your own local scores and the public scores. Public scores will need to be submitted and checked before displayed.

Once you have curated your speedrun, you may start by pressing the Start button in the center of your screen. This will open every link onto your browser and start the timer for the speedrun. Remember to enable pop-ups!

Once you have finished all runs, you may submit your run and finalize your time. Your time will be stored in local storage, and ranked upon your local leaderboard.


# To add in the future

Custom Games! Currently, I only provide the runs in the base run. I hope to add a way to include custom links soon!
